Clean Up - Give Back is a mobile app designed to streamline the volunteer tracking process for a non-profit organization. The app allows volunteers, after signing up, to track ang log their cleanup sessions through GPS and photo verification (by an admin on the app who verifies the photos), while also handling payment for cleaning kits. This comes as a modernization of the organization's system, which relied on manual verfification and logging through text message exchange with an admin.
