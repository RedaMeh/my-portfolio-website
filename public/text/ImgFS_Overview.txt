The ImgFS project involves creating an image-oriented file system inspired by Facebook's "Haystack." It manages large image collections efficiently by combining metadata and images in a single file, enabling fast access, deduplication using SHA-256, and automatic multi-resolution storage. Initially developed as a command-line tool for inserting, deleting, and retrieving images, it extends to a webserver for HTTP-based image access.
