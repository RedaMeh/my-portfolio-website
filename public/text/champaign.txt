Champaign, USA (2024–2025): The new experiences just keep flowing! Thanks to my strong academic performance during my three years at EPFL, I earned the opportunity to spend my final year of Bachelor as an exchange student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Returning to the United States was a goal of mine ever since I had left, so achieving this milestone was a proud and exciting moment.

UIUC offers a vibrant and diverse campus life, and the academic opportunities here are equally impressive. 

This year represents a unique blend of familiarity and discovery—revisiting the country that inspired me during my previous exchange while embracing the new adventures that come with being part of such a renowned university.
