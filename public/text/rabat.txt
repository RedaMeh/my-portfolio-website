Rabat, Morocco (2002-2019): This is where it all started! Born and raised here, I have nothing but good memories. From the beautiful beaches to the people 
to the food, there is a lot to enjoy. It's also been amazing watching my country develop and modernize as I grew up, through the addition of a tramway in my city and 
building the world's largest concentrated solar power plant in Noor Power Station among other projects and initiatives.
