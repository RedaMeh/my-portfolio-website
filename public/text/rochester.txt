Rochester, New York (2019-2020): Ah, wonderful Rochester. After 17 years of living in Morocco, it was time for a new adventure. Thanks to a selective scholarship exchange program (The YES program), sponsored by the U.S. State 
department, I was able to spend an academic year in a high school in the United States, hosted by an American host family. Beyond the amazing experiences that I've had in terms of traveling and forging personality, 
that is when I knew what I wanted to study for college. As we entered Covid times, Johns Hopkins University was in charge of data collection and display for the public. I was fascinated by how powerful Computer Science, 
and more specifically Data Science, must have been to process the sheer amount of data available.
